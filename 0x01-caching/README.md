# Caching System

This project involves implementing different caching algorithms in Python. The caching algorithms covered in this project include FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without any external help:

- What a caching system is
- What FIFO (First In, First Out) means
- What LIFO (Last In, First Out) means
- What LRU (Least Recently Used) means
- What MRU (Most Recently Used) means
- What LFU (Least Frequently Used) means
- The purpose of a caching system
- The limitations of a caching system

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- `base_caching.py`: Contains the `BaseCaching` class, which defines the base structure for the caching system.
- `0-basic_cache.py`: Contains the implementation of the `BasicCache` class, which is a basic caching system without any limits.
- `1-fifo_cache.py`: Contains the implementation of the `FIFOCache` class, which is a caching system using the FIFO algorithm.
- `2-lifo_cache.py`: Contains the implementation of the `LIFOCache` class, which is a caching system using the LIFO algorithm.
- `3-lru_cache.py`: Contains the implementation of the `LRUCache` class, which is a caching system using the LRU algorithm.
- `4-mru_cache.py`: Contains the implementation of the `MRUCache` class, which is a caching system using the MRU algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## Requirements

- All Python files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- The code should follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- All modules should have a documentation string.
- All classes should have a documentation string.
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation string.
- Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module,
